-- The following piece of code aims to implement the function
-- string2Expr :: String -> Expr mentioned in the coursework, at question 3.a).
-- Feel free to use that code to check whether your answer to question 3.a) is
-- correct or not. You are also free to reuse part of it in your submission if
-- you find that useful, or ask on the board on canvas if there is a piece of
-- syntax you do not understand in there.

-- I do not claim that the code below is particularly elegant and it is
-- certainly not documented. But to the best of my knowledge, it should do the
-- job.

-- It is written using only material we have covered in the lecture. But if you
-- have ever a need to parse non-trivial expessions in the future (typically
-- anything that requires to check for proper bracketing), I would suggest
-- not using the same approach (which is quite painful as you can see), but
-- dedicated parsing tools and libraries. In the Haskell ecosystem there are
-- two popular approaches (afaik): parser generators (one is called _happy_) and
-- parser combinators libraries such as _Parsec_.
